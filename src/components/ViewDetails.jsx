            Bandarban District is located in southeastern Bangladesh and is the
            southern part of the mountainous region of Chittagong Hill Tracts
            and borders Myanmar. The most important rivers of the district,
            which is two-thirds dominated by forests and mountains, are the
            Bakkhali, Matamuhuri and the Shankha. The Bandarban district is home
            to the highest mountain in Bangladesh. However, it is still unclear
            whether this is the Keokradong in the southeast of the Upazila Ruma
            or the Mowdok Mual in the Upazila Thanchi.

            During our tour we’ll also visit Boga Lake. A local legend tells
            that Boga Lake was created after the inhabitants of a Khumi village
            killed and ate a deity who later reappeared to them in the form of a
            dragon. Instantly an earthquake occurred, the hillside caved in, and
            the village disappeared and formed a deep lake. The color of the
            lake varies at different times at a day depending upon the sunlight,
            humidity, and clouds. During your tour you’ll be visiting: – Meghla
            Tourists Spot – Nilgiris – Nilachol – Shoilo Propat Waterfall – The
